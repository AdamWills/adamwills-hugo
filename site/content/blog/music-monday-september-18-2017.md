<p class="lead">Once in awhile I share some music that has caught my attention over the last while.</p>

## Moonlight Desires

The guys over at Moonlight Desires ("a rock band from Hamilton that transforms synth based 80's pop hits into guitar-driven anthems") have just released their latest album, 'Just The Hits: 1981​-​1985' and is a whole lot of fun. Check out their video for the track "Valerie" (based on the original video) below.

You can check out the [full album on Bandcamp](https://moonlightdesires.bandcamp.com/). They've also re-released and re-mastered their first album, '[Frankie Goes to Hamilton](https://moonlightdesires.bandcamp.com/album/frankie-goes-to-hamilton)', also available via Bandcamp.

## Myrkur - Mareridt

I'm only a couple listens in, but I can already tell that this album will be sticking around in constant rotation for awhile.

## Leprous - Malina
One of my most anticipated albums of the year, Norway's Leprous returns with another solid album of progressive metal. One of the highlights of the album is the first single, "From the Flame", which is one of the catchier tracks.

## Tanya Tagaq
This past month's Supercrawl festival in Hamilton included Tanya Tagaq, an artist that I've been wanting to see for awhile now. Her set featured a 45+ minute improv with some amazing musicians (featuring drums, a violin, a theramin and more). This was one of the most intriguing performances that I've experienced (experience is definitely the appropriate word) - you can see a similar performance from last year's CBC Music Festival below.

I can not wait to see her again.

## Vuur - My Champion

The latest video released from VUUR, a new progressive metal band featuring the incredibly talented Anneke van Giersbergen on vocals. Their new album comes out on October 20th, 2017.
