## Raphael Weinroth-Browne - Ricercare

Created for the [Shot in the Dark Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLUFIrPgzMljClco2SfS6aA), Raphael is back with another mesmerizing performance of one of his original pieces.

## Zeal & Ardor - The Devil is Mine

Thanks to [Portable City](http://www.portablecity.net/) for this one. Zeal & Ardor mix together “African American spirituals, blues, and black metal” creating something that is truly unique (at least to my ears).
